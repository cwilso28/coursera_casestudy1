# Coursera Case Study 1: Cyclistic Data Analysis
## Overview
This is a revisit of the Coursera case study 1 data analysis process. The ask of this case study was to use bike-share data to determine differences between casual and member riders, the two groups that the bike-share users could be categorized in. The previous analysis used a mixture of Excel, SQL, and R. The noteboook in this repository consolidates the previous analysis down into one script and demonstrates the the use of Python, Pandas, Jupyter notebooks, and R. The notebook has been run so it is ready to read without any further steps. Enjoy!
